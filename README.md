# EV-Charging-Highway-segment-lanes

Problem Statement: As we know EV’s are slowly replacing the conventional IC engine vehicles in the long run, but in developing countries like India they are still an emerging technology with many drawbacks; one major issue is, of them not being highway friendly or convenient for interstate commute. Although we have charging stations in India but they have slower charging rates, the vehicles have comparatively shorter range and they are very time consuming, people cannot afford to wait hours on a highway to charge their vehicles. All these factors hold millions of Indians from investing in an EV at the moment.


Introduction:
Need: Setting up stationary charging stations is a possible option but it comes with many drawbacks. Stationary charging stations have slower charging rates and are not available near every highway or expressways. Since the charging rates are low the process of getting our vehicles charged will also be very long and the wait times give no beneficial returns.

Even the stationary charging stations would have limited charging points which will consume more time, since people will have to wait for others to finish. According to the Grant Thornton Bharat-Ficci report, India requires 4,00,000 charging stations over the next 5 years to fulfill its growing demand for EV’s. India is set to have 2 million EV’s on road by 2026.

Possible Solution: Advancements in the battery technology has been made by many companies, but still there is no significant rise in the range of EV’s. For example: Tata Nexon EV gives 327 Km range with full charge whereas its IC engine variant can give a range of 960 Km range with full tank.
With the depletion of fossil fuels and the rising greenhouse gas emissions the world is rapidly shifting towards greener options like- electric vehicles. In the next decade the majority of traditional IC engine vehicles would be replaced by EV’s.

To make more people invest in EV’s and make interstate commutes more accessible and convenient, our solution is to eventually change the method of charging them.
Our Solution: EV Charging Highway segment lanes. The idea is to introduce copper overhead cables [OHE] for a certain distance (approx. 1km) parallel to the highways. These cables wouldn’t cover all of the highway, they’ll be present in small segments. The overhead cables would carry 220V– 440V; 25A alternating current that will be converted by onboard rectifiers on the vehicle. On these extended lanes EV’s can easily charge and move ahead at the same time. The EV will be using a specially designed-height adjustable pantograph which will be installed at the rear end of the vehicle to draw power from the OHE.

The pantograph’s external structure is made of carbon fiber, and they use carbon brushes for contacting the overhead cables that ensure no sparks while moving.
The vehicle’s battery doesn’t discharge while it is charging on the lanes as we are introducing bypass charging, wherein the two arms of pantograph are so connected as to give two parallel connections to the EV from the OHE cables, where one arm is connected to the battery via supercapacitor banks through an adapter whereas the other arm is connected directly to the AC induction motors. So, while the vehicle is moving on the charging lane the motor will draw power directly from the overhead cables and not from the battery meanwhile the battery would charge without discharging.  

The supercapacitor banks are a high-capacity capacitor with a capacitance value much higher than other capacitors which typically stores 10 to 100 times more energy per unit volume or mass than electrolytic capacitors and can accept and deliver charge much faster than batteries. These are introduced (~800 F) so as to increase the charging rate as the lanes are quite small (approx. 1km) and the vehicles would cover the lanes in a short period of time. 
The car can also be equipped with a simple autopilot which detects as soon as the pantograph attaches to the OHE cable and takes over the controls of the vehicle and maintains the heading so that the driver too can relax while their vehicle is getting dynamically charged.

Example: Let’s say a particular vehicle moving at an average speed of 60kmph gives 10 km of drive after 1 minute of fast supercharge. So, if we install a 1km charging lane after every 10 km of highway, by the time the car reaches the next supercharging lane it would be ready for recharging.

Existing similar solution: Recently an Israeli company suggested charging EV’s wirelessly through embedding energy transfer coils inside the road itself, but this would cause problems if people accidently step on those roads, also wireless charging on average uses around 47% more power than a cable. And the magnetic fields may also cause interference with other electrical machines/components such as motors and reduce their efficiency. The lanes wouldn’t cause such problems as it uses OHE cables and there would be significant electricity savings as direct connections are used. Eventually EV’s will become cheaper and not a rarity. 
Novelty: EV’s are perfect for city commutes but when going longer distances on a highway or interstate travels is where it falls short. People are not ready to wait for 4-5 hours to get their vehicles charged. So, increasing the range of the vehicles is the need of hour which battery technology cannot do for next two decades hence there is a need for an alternative solution.  

Why is this idea better than installing stationary charging points on highways?
The reason is, stationary charging stations don’t charge the vehicle at a high speed which makes them very time consuming. For example: If the charging stations are fully occupied then new vehicles that arrive have to wait for a longer time as they will have to first wait for their turn and then charge their vehicles. Whereas in the superfast charging lanes, cars can line up one behind another and charge simultaneously.

Robustness: As the pantograph’s skeleton is made of carbon fiber hence it is stress resistant as well as a good insulator.
Feasibility: This is a visionary project aimed at the next two decades that requires government’s involvement as it will take another 30-35 years to introduce a better battery that gives range equivalent to IC engine vehicles and has a very short duration of charging time. As the EV’s are yet to be introduced in India in mass, the transportation ministry has to work along with the company’s R&D department and suggests them to provide pantograph, supercapacitors and install bypass charging before rolling out their product in country and the government has to plan the supercharging lanes so that these can be easily found on google maps. The user can plug in the pantograph before they are planning out on a long drive on a highway. The pantograph is as easy to plugin as plugging in a normal EV charger. Due to the inclusion of a simple autopilot the driver can relax while the car is being charged which prevents them from keeping a steady control in that narrow superfast charging lane.
The pantographs are height adjustable and the overhead cables will be placed in such a way that in future when EV trucks and buses are introduced in mass in India they too can cover longer distances without any problem. 

Applicability: This idea is applicable for long run, we all know EV’s will slowly replace all IC engine vehicles on road and as their demand increases people who own one would prefer going distances on their vehicles and the reasons that has been keeping people away for so long, from EV’s like longer range, charging speed are going to be solved by our idea.
